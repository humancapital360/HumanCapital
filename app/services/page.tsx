Unlike traditional, linear city communication models, ENRS enables residents to submit informal grievances, upload supporting photographs, and receive a response ticket. When necessary, members of our Environmental Service Technicians (i.e., junk, trash, pest, insects, and landscaping) are dispatched, and thereon an incident report is generated. By giving residents a voice, ENRS fosters empathy, validation, and a sense of partnership. These positive dynamics encourage individuals to take ownership of their community and strengthen their connection to the neighborhood.",
